# About our project
Team NaCl is creating an Android application which will work with a database and a mobile barcode scanner for the School of Natural Sciences at Indiana University Southeast. By implementing a barcode scanning system, our application will be used to maintain inventory management of lab equipment for the school's 56 laboratories. Upon scanning the barcode, users will be able to keep track of the lab equipment's serial number, item description, and location in which it is assigned to.
